Waveform Generator
=========

### A simple customizable function generator  

Shapes: Sine, Square, Sawtooth
Frequencies: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 Hz
Peak-to-peak: 1, 2, 3.3 V
Duty cycle: 10%, 20%, . . . 80%, 90%

## Controls:

The keypad is used to adjust the frequencies, wave types, duty cycle, and peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp). 
The keypad buttons 1-5 set the frequency of the current wave to 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, and 500 Hz, respectively. 
Pressing the 7 button shows the square wave, pressing the 8 button shows the sine wave, and pressing the 9 button shows the sawtooth wave. 
For the square wave only, a variable duty cycle is supported, with a minimum value of 10% and maximum value of 90%. 
Pushing the * button decreases the square wave duty cycle by 10%, and pushing the # button increases the duty cycle by 10%. 
Pushing the 0 button resets the duty cycle to 50%. 
The *, 0, and # buttons have no effect on the sine or sawtooth waveforms.
Peak-to-peak voltages of 1 V, 2 V, and 3.3 V are supported, and are accessed by pressing the 6 key in order to utilize the next Vpp.
